This is the API for my back-end capstone.  The stores image URLs and the emotions from Microsoft Cognitive Services and allows the front end to access this together.

The API key for this no longer works and a new one will need to be obtained from MCS.  The goal of this program was to create an API that would store the images and the emotionality so it could be used with a front-end application which would take the data and display it using Chart.js
